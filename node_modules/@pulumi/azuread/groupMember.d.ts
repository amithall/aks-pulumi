import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages a single Group Membership within Azure Active Directory.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Do not use this resource at the same time as `azuread_group.members`.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const exampleUser = azuread.getUser({
 *     userPrincipalName: "jdoe@hashicorp.com",
 * });
 * const exampleGroup = new azuread.Group("exampleGroup", {});
 * const exampleGroupMember = new azuread.GroupMember("exampleGroupMember", {
 *     groupObjectId: exampleGroup.id,
 *     memberObjectId: exampleUser.then(exampleUser => exampleUser.id),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Azure Active Directory Group Members can be imported using the `object id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/groupMember:GroupMember test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/member/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
