import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages an App Role associated with an Application within Azure Active Directory.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const exampleApplication = new azuread.Application("exampleApplication", {});
 * const exampleApplicationAppRole = new azuread.ApplicationAppRole("exampleApplicationAppRole", {
 *     applicationObjectId: exampleApplication.id,
 *     allowedMemberTypes: ["User"],
 *     description: "Admins can manage roles and perform all task actions",
 *     displayName: "Admin",
 *     enabled: true,
 *     value: "administer",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * App Roles can be imported using the `object_id` of an Application and the `id` of the App Role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/applicationAppRole:ApplicationAppRole test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/role/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
