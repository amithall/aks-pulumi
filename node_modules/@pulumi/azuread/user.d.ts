import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages a User within Azure Active Directory.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to `Directory.ReadWrite.All` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = new azuread.User("example", {
 *     displayName: "J. Doe",
 *     mailNickname: "jdoe",
 *     password: "SecretP@sswd99!",
 *     userPrincipalName: "jdoe@hashicorp.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Azure Active Directory Users can be imported using the `object id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/user:User my_user 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
 * ```
