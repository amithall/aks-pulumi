/**
 * Gets information about an existing Service Principal associated with an Application within Azure Active Directory.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### By Application Display Name)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(azuread.getServicePrincipal({
 *     displayName: "my-awesome-application",
 * }));
 * ```
 * ### By Application ID)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(azuread.getServicePrincipal({
 *     applicationId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 * }));
 * ```
 * ### By Object ID)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(azuread.getServicePrincipal({
 *     objectId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 * }));
 * ```
