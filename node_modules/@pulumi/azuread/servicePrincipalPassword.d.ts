import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages a password credential associated with a service principal within Azure Active Directory. See also the azuread.ApplicationPassword resource.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const exampleApplication = new azuread.Application("exampleApplication", {});
 * const exampleServicePrincipal = new azuread.ServicePrincipal("exampleServicePrincipal", {applicationId: exampleApplication.applicationId});
 * const exampleServicePrincipalPassword = new azuread.ServicePrincipalPassword("exampleServicePrincipalPassword", {servicePrincipalId: exampleServicePrincipal.objectId});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Passwords can be imported using the `object id` of a Service Principal and the `key id` of the password, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/servicePrincipalPassword:ServicePrincipalPassword test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/password/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
