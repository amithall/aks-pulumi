import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages a password credential associated with an application within Azure Active Directory. These are also referred to as client secrets during authentication.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const exampleApplication = new azuread.Application("exampleApplication", {});
 * const exampleApplicationPassword = new azuread.ApplicationPassword("exampleApplicationPassword", {applicationObjectId: exampleApplication.objectId});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Passwords can be imported using the `object id` of an Application and the `key id` of the password, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/applicationPassword:ApplicationPassword test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/password/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
