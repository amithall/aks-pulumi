import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Manages an OAuth 2.0 Permission Scope associated with an application.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const exampleApplication = new azuread.Application("exampleApplication", {});
 * const exampleApplicationOauth2PermissionScope = new azuread.ApplicationOauth2PermissionScope("exampleApplicationOauth2PermissionScope", {
 *     applicationObjectId: exampleApplication.id,
 *     adminConsentDescription: "Administer the application",
 *     adminConsentDisplayName: "Administer",
 *     enabled: true,
 *     type: "User",
 *     userConsentDescription: "Administer the application",
 *     userConsentDisplayName: "Administer",
 *     value: "administer",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * OAuth2 Permission Scopes can be imported using the `object_id` of an Application and the `id` of the Permission Scope, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/applicationOauth2PermissionScope:ApplicationOauth2PermissionScope test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/scope/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
